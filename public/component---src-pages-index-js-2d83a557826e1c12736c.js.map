For example:\n * \n *     var html = Autolinker.link( \"Joe went to www.yahoo.com\", {\n *         newWindow : false,\n *         truncate  : 30\n *     } );\n *     // produces: 'Joe went to <a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com\">yahoo.com</a>'\n * \n * \n * ## Custom Replacements of Links\n * \n * If the configuration options do not provide enough flexibility, a {@link #replaceFn} may be provided to fully customize\n * the output of Autolinker.
